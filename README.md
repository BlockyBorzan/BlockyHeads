# BlockyHeads


BlockyHeads is a simple plugin that adds another layer of depth to Minecraft's existing PvE system. **Mobs drop their heads** when killed by players and you get to decide everything about it. It features **fully customizable drop rates**, **RPG like unlock systems for mobs**, **monetary head values** and much more.
